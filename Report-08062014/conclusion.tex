\todo{Issues:
1) PNNL.bin tested is a small input. Even this small input brought significant run-to-run variations.
2) We did not achieve much energy savings in Table 1.
3) Initial test of some larger input makes one loop of the three loops dominant. Our approach
is not applicable to applications with a dominant loop.
4) Larger input has even more significant run-to-run variance. We cannot tell whether
the increase of execution time is due to energy setting or randomness brought by concurrency. }
