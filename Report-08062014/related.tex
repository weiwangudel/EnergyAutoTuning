Reducing Energy Usage with Memory and Computation-Aware Dynamic Frequency Scaling
characterizes applications using static analysis and runtime tracing that automatically
acquires application signatures - characterizations of the patterns of execution of 
each loop in an application. The characterization is matched with a set of benchmark 
loops, which have been fully explored for optimal frequency setting. 

It would be good if we can test Alexandra's Decoupled Access-Execute model, 
where they called for faster DVFS transition and \textit{modelled} faster DVFS 
for fine-grained access phase. 
We should test whether Duty Cycle Modulation is a good alternative to waiting for 
DVFS transition to be close to instantaneous.
