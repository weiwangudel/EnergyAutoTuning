Dynamic Voltage and Frequncy Scaling (DVFS) and Duty Cycle Modulation (DCM)are 
two \{complimentary?\} techniques for putting processors into low power mode. 
In this report, we propose to apply different DVFS and DCM settings to loops within 
an application according to their characterization. 
Different loops of the same application exhibit different charateristics and 
may prefer different settings. By applying the ``best'' power level setting 
to each loop, energy savings could be achieved. 
%Duty Cycle Modulation has low transition overhead but only affects ``effective'' frequency while DVFS has transition overhead but is  
Our experiments show that we can reduce energy consumption of applications
by applying ``right'' DCM setting for the ``right'' loops.
