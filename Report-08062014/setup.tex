The tests ran on a machine with dual socket 8-core Intel Xeon E5-2680 processor with 20MB (40MB total) L3 cache.
The input graph is pnnl.bin, with which the whole application finishes in about 22 seconds.
It contains three (among many) most significant loops. Each of the loops takes about 3 seconds. 
%To protect against low start-up energy/power measurements, the system was warmed up
%with a computational intensive script before any test was executed.
