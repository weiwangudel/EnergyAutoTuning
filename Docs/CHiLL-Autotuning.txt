Two versions of CHiLL
  -- standalone CHiLL 
    === cannot take .c file as input
    === usually transform fortran code to SUIF code (scc) and then use s2f (to fortran)
  -- CHiLL with ROSE
    === works similiarly as polyopt
    === did not generate cuda-chill, because it requires ROSE to be re-configured and re-built
    === only generated chill (to transform and generate rose_Whatever.c file).
    === Need to change ROSEHOME, BOOSTHOME to my elo "ROSE_ROOT", "BOOST_ROOT".
    === still based on the ROSE version installed on weiwang@elo.hpc.renci.org
    === ../../chill gemm.script
    === it can also transform one file of an application contains many files, but it will
        complain about missing Main functions
    === Often encounters this fatal error:
chill: Cxx_Grammar.C:69275: SgSymbolTable* SgScopeStatement::get_symbol_table() const: Assertion `this != __null' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
