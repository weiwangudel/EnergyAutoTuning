0. target6 = driverForGraphClusteringScaleRuns  
   change to gcc/g++ compiler, genertae the above executable but got segfault error.
========================================================================================================
1. target5 = driverForGraphClustering
   adding the missing arguments in driverForGraphClustering.cpp to generate executable 'driverForGraphClustering'

2. Run rose to get energyAPIs added
  ******** __sync_fetch_and_add not supported by ROSE
   RngStream Rng[nT]; not supported by ROSE

3. Some file cannot go through ROSE even without sync_fetch_and_add:
   buildNextPhase:  forStatment != NULL assert failure
  ROSE will panic at the following statements.

     map<long,long>** cluPtrIn = (map<long,long>**) malloc(numUniqueClusters*sizeof(map<long,long>*)); 
     for (long i=0; i<numUniqueClusters; i++)
         cluPtrIn[i] = NULL;    
It complains about assert (forStatment != NULL) 
   Assertion `forstmt != __null' failed
  Solution: remove omp parallel

   Another place in buildNextPhase.cpp that doesn't support OpenMP well. 
   line ~416 bug

4. utilityFunctions.cpp  contains segfault omp parallel (in ROSE only? maybe ScaleRuns also has problems here?)
	#pragma omp parallel
      {
        int myRank = omp_get_thread_num();
  	#pragma omp for 
          for (long i=0; i<size; i++) {
              RandVec[i] =  RngArray[myRank].RandU01();
          }
      }//End of parallel region   
temporary fix:
      serialize it.
 52 //#pragma omp parallel
 53     {
 54 //      int myRank = omp_get_thread_num();
 55 //#pragma omp for 
 56         for (long i=0; i<size; i++) {
 57             RandVec[i] =  RngArray[i%16].RandU01();
 58         }
 59     }//End of parallel region
