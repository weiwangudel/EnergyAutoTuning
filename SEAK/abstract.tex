Reducing application energy consumption is important to improve user experience of 
embedded systems, e.g. smart phones, GPS navigators etc.  
However applications (kernels) are not energy-aware in its design stage. 
Tuning for energy efficiency is necessary to meet the system's energy constraints.
In this work we use energy-aware framework to tune Polybench kernels for energy
 on two architectures (Intel SandyBridge and Intel MIC).
We applied combinations of loop optimizations to the kernels and observed 
for dense matrix kernels like \texttt{2mm} and \texttt{gemm}, \emph{the optimization that has the minimum execution time 
did not consume the least amount of energy}. This means execution time does \emph{not}
always correlate to the energy consumption. We also found that the optimizations 
that work best on one architecture do not carry to another.
