In this work, we evaluate six representative Polybench programs for energy auto-tuning using
loop optimizations: 2mm, gemm, gramschmidt, covariance, seidel-2d, and jacobi-2d.

Using PoCC, program variants were generated using
a different set of the 
optimizations from the following four groups: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loop fusion: smartfuse, maxfuse, nofuse
    \item Loop unrolling factor: 1, 2, 4, 8
    \item Loop tiling: 1, 16, 32, 64. Note that the number of different flags
 depends on the level of nested loops   
    \item Loop vectorization: on, off
\end{itemize}
Loop parallelization was always turned on.
%During execution, periodic queries to the RCRtool blackboard provide the energy consumption information.
