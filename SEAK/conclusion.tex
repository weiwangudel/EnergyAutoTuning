In this paper, we tuned six representative Polybench programs for energy on
an Intel Sandy Bridge processor and a Xeon Phi processor by applying loop 
transformations. For 2mm and gemm Polybench, we observed \emph{non-correlated}
speedups and energy savings over the default, i.e. \emph{fastest execution does not
gaurantee fewest energy consumption}. For the other four benchmmarks, 
we observed correlated speedups and energy savings.
We also showed that good loop transformations for one architecture did 
not have as good performance on the other architecture.
