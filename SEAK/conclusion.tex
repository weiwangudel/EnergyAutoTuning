In this paper, we tuned six representative Polybench kernels for energy on
an Intel SandyBridge processor and an Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor by applying various loop 
transformations. For the \texttt{2mm} and \texttt{gemm} kernels (dense matrix kernels),
we observed \emph{non-correlated} speedups and energy savings over the baseline version,
i.e. \emph{fastest execution does not guarantee fewest energy consumption}. 
We also showed that good loop transformations for one architecture do not carry over to
other architectures.
