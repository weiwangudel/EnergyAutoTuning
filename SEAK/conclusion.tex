Individual optimization can however
have significant impact on the power required by an
application. In the Polybench program, \emph{covariance},
using the ``maxfuse'' option resulted in a 20+\% percent power
increase. With the correct tile size ``maxfuse'' also
resulted in the 50+\% time decrease. ``maxfuse'' increases power 
consumption but reduces total energy required to complete the computation due to
the decrease in execution time.
Understanding how power and energy are used at the small
scale can contribute to the understanding of power/energy requirements of Exascale applications.

Polyhedral optimization techniques can provide significant 
increases in performance
