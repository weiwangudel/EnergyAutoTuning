In this paper, we tuned six representative Polybench programs for energy on
an Intel Sandy Bridge processor and a Xeon Phi processor by applying loop 
transformations. We observed speedups and energy savings over the default
 on both architectures and for all the benchmarks.
We showed that good loop transformations for one architecture did 
not promise as good performance on the other architecture.
