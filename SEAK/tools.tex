%To understand energy consumption, execution time and various optimizations,
%a light-weight fine-grained measurement RCRtool is required. 
For energy consumption reporting, \texttt{RCRtool} is available to any
application through a region-based call API.
When an application halts elapsed time, energy use, and average computed
power is reported for (a) each region and (b) the entire application.

The Intel SandyBridge architecture allows users to track energy usage through 
the exposed Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) hardware counter. 
The \texttt{RCRtool} records the current energy value of the counter at least 1000 times a second by writing 
into a shared-memory data structure. %This ``blackboard'' structure provides a hierarchical view of the system
%where various current performance information is stored. 

On MIC \texttt{RCRtool} tracks power usage through a file updated every 50 millisecond.
RCRtool monitors the power at user level and computes the energy consumption over time.

Finding the optimal combination of compiler optimizations 
requires a compilation framework. The Polyhedral Compiler Collection (PoCC) was used to generate program 
variants with different optimizations. Intel Compiler v14.0.2 was used as the backend compiler for this work. 
%The PoCC requires that programs contain static control parts (SCoP) so that 
%valid transformations can be applied. Polybench is a collection of programs
%that contain SCoPs and we experiment with Polybench in this paper.
