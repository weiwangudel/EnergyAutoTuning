Previously we have observed that tuning for execution can be used as a proxy to tuning for EDP (Energy-Delay Product).
In this report, we look deeper into the power impact of individual loop optimizations and the interactive effect on
power and execution time when multiple loop optimizations are applied. 
This report shed light on how, when and why do optimizations interact.
