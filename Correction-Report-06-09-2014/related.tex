Is energy-minimum = time minimum?

Yes. \cite{us} applied polyhedral optimizations to generate multiple program variants 
with various optimizations including loop fusion, unrolloing, tiling, and vectorization
for OpenMP programs. Their results show a strong correlation between execution time 
and energy consumption. 
Yuki et al. developed a high-level energy model of power consumption under Dynamic
Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and found it best to
run as fast as possible to completion [26] (Folklore confirmed). 


No.
