In this work, we evaluate \texttt{covariance} Polybench program for understanding the power impact of 
different loop optimizations.
%the following loop optimizations: 
%\texttt{2mm}, \texttt{gemm}, \texttt{gramschmidt}, \texttt{covariance}, \texttt{seidel-2d}, and \texttt{jacobi-2d}.
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Loop fusion: smartfuse, maxfuse, nofuse
%    \item Loop unrolling factor: 1, 2, 4, 8
%    \item Loop tiling: 1, 16, 32, 64 
%    \item Loop vectorization: on, off
%    \item Loop parallelization: on, off
%\end{itemize}
